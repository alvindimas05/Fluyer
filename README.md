## 🐞 Known Issues

### macOS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🔐 The app is **not notarized** due to Apple Developer fees. macOS will warn that Fluyer “cannot be verified.” This is expected and harmless.

#### macOS 14 (Sonoma) and below:
1. Right-click `Fluyer.app`
2. Select **Open**
3. Confirm again in the dialog

#### macOS 15 (Sequoia) and above:
1. Open the app — it will be blocked
2. Go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security`
3. Scroll down and click **Open Anyway**
4. Confirm and authenticate
5. Open again from **Applications**

---

### Linux

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🧩 If you're using the `.deb`, there is a chance that you might need to **install mpv** manually.

```bash
sudo apt install mpv
```

---

### Universal

- 🚫 **High resource usage** due to animated background. It’s currently disabled, but the background image remains enabled.

---

### iOS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🍏 **iOS version is not available.** Although previously tested, I don’t plan to release it due to Apple Developer fees.
